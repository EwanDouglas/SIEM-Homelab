Before starting up any virtual machine for the first time, I will tweak ny settings to suit my needs and take a screenshot. Every system is different, so be sure to change your settings accordingly.

A screenshot will allow us to revert back to this point later on if something goes wrong. Remember to take screenshots often so you don't lose your work!

The setup is very easy, just select "Graphical Install" and go through the installation steps. Use the default for most settings and check out the online resources if you have any questions!

This is where you will decide your desktop environment, which has a large effect in how your desktop will look and feel. I like xfce but I encourage everyone to experiment!

It may take a while to install, for me it was around 10 minutes.

An agent is a software program that is installed on a device, such as a server or endpoint, to collect and send data to a centralized system for analysis and monitoring. In the context of Elastic SIEM, an agent is used to collect and forward security-related events from your endpoints to your Elastic SIEM instance.
